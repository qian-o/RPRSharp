# RPRSharp

This repository is developed based on the C# bindings provided by [RadeonProRenderSDK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RadeonProRenderSDK), improving its enums and structs to make the calling method more suitable for C# developers.

The interface code has been double-checked on the [RadeonProRender_v2.h](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RadeonProRenderSDK/blob/master/RadeonProRender/inc/RadeonProRender_v2.h) file provided by the [RadeonProRenderSDK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RadeonProRenderSDK) repository, and all the interfaces have been implemented. The current code version is 3.1.5.

The code is currently in the early stages of development, and it cannot be guaranteed that all interfaces are functional. I will continue to improve the code based on the tutorial examples provided by RadeonProRenderSDK, and I also welcome contributions from the community.
